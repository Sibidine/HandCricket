# HandCricket
My first ever repo, using code from when I was 14, please don't judge.  
Crazy is Normal handcricket, but with a few extra rules:-  
-The bowler gets a wicket if the difference between the two throws is one (eg: if you as the batter throw 7, and the bowler throws 6, he/she gets a wicket)  
-If the two throws are the same, then the runs you would normally have scored get squared (eg: if both the bowler and the batter throw 8, 64 (aka 8 squared) gets added to the batters run total)  

Handcricket is the base version of the game, without the extra rules Crazy entails.
